Image Descriptions:

Overview:

Large text reads: ‘DRAWING FROM THE GARDEN’. The text is bright yellow-green on a black background. The font has extremely chaotic creepy-crawly energy and looks quite delicate and organic. Each letter is made out of many thin, squiggly drawings of different insects such as spiders, beetles and caterpillars.

Q:

An enlarged uppercase ‘Q’. The body of the Q is made of a bee, spider, moth, dragonfly and several other insects. Its cross stroke is made out of a large thick caterpillar with jaws at both ends!

N:

An enlarged uppercase ‘N’. A suspicious-looking mosquito, moth, ladybird beetle, butterfly and spider form the N’s diagonal stroke.

L:

An enlarged uppercase ‘L’. A caterpillar with segmented articulations is forming most of the horizontal stroke. A big butterfly forms the top of the L’s stem.

Alphabet:

The english alphabet is enlarged to show each letter. Some letters are taller or shorter than others and there are no clear guidelines. Spacing is pretty janky.
