# Makeshift Insects

This typeface was drawn on the land of the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation, whose sovereignty was never ceded.

Makeshift Insects is a collaboratively drawn typeface constructed from insects. In an online workshop with Arts House, artists and mentors from the Makeshift Publics program were invited to create a strange typeface in two stages:

1. We each drew a small insect

2. We collaboratively constructed an alphabet using our insects as building blocks

The typeface also contains individual insects (implemented via a contextual alternates feature) which are automatically substituted when their code names are typed.

In our workshop we used a shared Figma document for drawing.
